      <h1>Kim Kardashian</h1>
      <p>
        Kimberly Noel Kardashian (formerly West; born October 21, 1980) is an
        American socialite, media personality, and businesswoman. She first
        gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but
        received wider notice after the sex tape Kim Kardashian, Superstar, shot
        in 2003 with her then-boyfriend Ray J, was released in 2007.[1] Later
        that year, she and her family began to appear in the E! reality
        television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–2021). Its
        success led to the formation of the spin-off series Kourtney and Kim
        Take New York (2011–2012), Kourtney and Kim Take Miami (2009–2013), and
        Hulu's The Kardashians (2022–present).
